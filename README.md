ABSTRACT
Benchmarking Machine Learning and AI Methods for QSAR Modeling

In recent years, artificial intelligence methods such as deep learning have been increasingly applied to augment the drug discovery process. Ranging from molecular property prediction to detection of phenotypes from microscopic images, deep learning has been applied to many tasks in this field. More recently, these methods have been used to generate novel descriptors such as molecular graphs and latent variables which are promising for molecular property prediction. Graph convolutional networks based on molecular graphs have been recently claimed to outperform other neural network based models and classical machine learning based models. This raises the need for a large-scale benchmark study, covering a panel of classical machine learning and AI-based methods that employ a range of traditional and novel molecular descriptors, to be able to arrive at an unbiased conclusion. In this study, we aim to address this by systematically applying a panel of ML and AI methods to the MoleculeNet datasets using different molecular descriptors. The resulting models will be thoroughly validated, and the best models will be reported.
